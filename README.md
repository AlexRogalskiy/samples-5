* [webserver](webserver/README.md): Simple example creating an NGINX webserver from a Custom Resource containing HTML code.

* [mysql-schema](mysql-schema/README.md): Operator managing schemas in a MySQL database.

* [tomcat](tomcat/README.md): Operator with two controllers, managing Tomcat instances and Webapps for these.
